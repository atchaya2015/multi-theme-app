PixelForge: Elevate Your Gaming Experience
Welcome to PixelForge, your ultimate destination for enhancing your gaming setup! This project is a dynamic React application designed to showcase premium gaming peripherals (like wireless controllers and headsets) while offering a unique theme-switching experience that allows you to customize your website's look and feel.

Features
Dynamic Theming: Seamlessly switch between multiple predefined themes (Theme 1: Minimal, Theme 2: Dark Sidebar, Theme 3: Colorful Grid) that instantly change the entire aesthetic of the website, including colors, fonts, and layout.

Theme Persistence: Your chosen theme is remembered across refreshes within the current browser session (it resets to Theme 1 on a full new session, as per your recent request).

Product Display: Browse a curated selection of gaming products, currently sourced from a reliable fake store API.

API Integration: Fetches product data from https://api.escuelajs.co/api/v1/products, demonstrating robust data fetching and error handling.

Image Fallback: Handles broken or missing product images gracefully by displaying a placeholder, ensuring a smooth user experience.

Responsive Layouts: Adapts the user interface for optimal viewing on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.

Modular Component Design: Built with reusable React components for maintainability and scalability.

React Router: Provides smooth client-side navigation between different pages (Home, About, Contact).

Global State Management: Manages theme state efficiently using React Context API.
